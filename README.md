## Simple CMS & API written in Go

This is a CMS & API written in Go. I've never written such a system before, so Go has wonderful opportunity â€“ this ecosystem encourages usage of small libraries, not big frameworks.

So far I have next ecosystem:

- gin framework for routing and static serving
- [sql driver](github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql)
- [imgio](github.com/anthonynsimon/bild/imgio) for image processing
